《rework》这本书看完留下最深的印象就是：开始做。
无论什么理由，什么想法，一切的一切只有执行最重要。
只是说说什么用都没有，要开始做。想法太廉价（一个想法能卖多少钱），执行得有多好才关键。

<!--more-->

失败不是成功之母，只有从成功的经验中才能学习到如何成功，而败的经验中学不到如何成功。

与其做个半成品，不如做好半个产品。

人不可能同时做所有的事情，并把事情做好。你的时间、资源、精力、注意力都是有限的。

一次做好一件事就已经不容易了。想一次做十件事？拉倒吧！

一切都从小开始，发展的话也不一定要扩大。不要在乎外界说什么做什么，做好自己的事就好。

再有就是司要有个性，有个性才有粉丝，有粉丝能帮你传播产品。

有时候引人们注意的一个方法是引起冲突，选择一个立场，然后等追随者出现。

下面是一些原文的摘抄：
Build half a product, not a half-assed product.

> *Taking a stand always stands out. People get stoked by conflict.
They take sides. Passions are ignited. And that's a good way to get people to take notice. 

> *Forgoing sleep is a bad idea. 
Sure, you get those extra hours right now, but you pay in spades later: You destroy your creativity, morale, and attitude.

> *It's easy to put your head down and just work on what you think needs to be done. 
It's a lot harder to pull your head up and ask why. 
Here are some important questions to ask yourself to ensure you're doing work that matters:

	- Why are you doing this?
	- What problem are you solving?
	-  Is this actually useful? 
	- Are you adding value?
	- Will this change behavior? 
	-  Is there an easier way? 
	- What could you be doing instead?
	- Is it really worth it? 

So before you sing the "not enough" blues,see how far you can get with what you have.

There is always enough time if you spend it right.And don't think you have to quit day job.
We are talking about squeezing out a few extra hours a week.That's enough time to get something going.
